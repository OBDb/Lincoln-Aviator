    description: "The original Lincoln Aviator was introduced as a mid-size luxury SUV positioned between the Navigator and the smaller Mountaineer in Lincoln's lineup. Based on the Ford Explorer platform, it featured distinctive Lincoln styling cues including a prominent waterfall grille and wraparound headlights. Powered by a 4.6-liter DOHC V8 engine producing 302 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque, paired with a five-speed automatic transmission and available with rear-wheel or all-wheel drive. The interior offered three rows of seating for six to seven passengers with luxury appointments including standard leather upholstery, American walnut wood trim, and dual-zone automatic climate control. Available features included a DVD-based navigation system, rear-seat entertainment, and a THX-certified audio system. The vehicle was produced from 2002 to 2005, with the final vehicle produced on August 19, 2005. Despite its premium positioning and strong performance, the first-generation Aviator struggled to establish itself in the market, competing with both its Ford Explorer relative and the larger Navigator within Lincoln's own lineup. Production ended after just three model years, with Lincoln refocusing its SUV strategy on the more successful Navigator."

    description: "After a 15-year hiatus, the Lincoln Aviator returned for the 2020 model year as an all-new three-row mid-size luxury SUV, with production commencing on May 6, 2019. The second-generation model is built on the CD6 platform (derived from the Ford Explorer sixth generation U625) and represents a departure from shared platform styling with a distinctly differentiated design. The exterior features elegant styling with horizontal lines, a distinctive grille, and a sloping roofline that creates a more dynamic profile than typical SUVs. Standard power comes from a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter EcoBoost V6 engine producing 400 horsepower and 415 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10-speed SelectShift automatic transmission. The Grand Touring plug-in hybrid (PHEV) model combines the same twin-turbocharged engine with a permanent magnet synchronous electric motor for a total system output of 494 horsepower and 630 lb-ft of torque, equipped with a 13.6-kWh lithium-ion battery offering approximately 21 miles of electric-only range. The interior showcases Lincoln's 'Quiet Flight' design philosophy with premium materials including available 30-way Perfect Position seats with massage functionality, open-pore wood trim, and a minimalist dashboard centered around a 10.1-inch touchscreen. Advanced technology includes the Phone As A Key feature allowing smartphone control (with wireless charging for phones), a 28-speaker Revel Ultima 3D audio system, and Lincoln's Co-Pilot360 Plus suite of driver assistance features. Adaptive suspension with Road Preview uses a forward-facing camera to detect road imperfections and adjust damping accordingly. The Air Glide suspension can lower the vehicle for easier entry and loading. Notable packages include the Black Label collection offering curated interior theme options and exclusive ownership benefits."
